# Heart Disease Prediction (Random Forest Classifier)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Beginner-level ML project done during internship-style training with full support and guidance.  
This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical features such as cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, etc.

## ðŸ§  Objective
To predict whether a person has heart disease (binary classification: 0 = No, 1 = Yes) using supervised learning.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## ðŸ“Š Algorithm Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
The model was trained on features such as age, sex, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and cholesterol levels.  
Key evaluation methods used:
- Accuracy score  
- Confusion matrix  
- Classification report  
- Feature importance plot

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
- Confusion matrix heatmap  
- Bar chart of top 5 most important features for prediction

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- [heart.csv](./heart.csv)
